#scikit-learn starting with machine learning in python

start a virtual environment, and install packages in requirements.

this is using python3.6

I'm using the windows linux subsystem, so it's defined as python3.6 on the command line, as ubuntu 16.04 is using 3.5.2 by default.

You'll want to install 3.6 separately.

## On WLS
On WLS you'll need to install package 3.6 from deadsnakes.

```javascript
var s = 'hi'
sudo apt-get install python3.6-tk
```
